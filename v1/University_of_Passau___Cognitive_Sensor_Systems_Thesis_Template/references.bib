abstract = {Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs) aim to address the curse of dimensionality that makes machine learning algorithms incompetent. Our study conceptually and empirically explores the most representative FEAs. First, we review the theoretical background of many FEAs from different categories (linear vs. nonlinear, supervised vs. unsupervised, random projection-based vs. manifold-based), present their algorithms, and conduct a conceptual comparison of these methods. Secondly, for three challenging binary and multi-class datasets, we determine the optimal sets of new features and assess the quality of the various transformed feature spaces in terms of statistical significance and power analysis, and the FEA efficacy in terms of classification accuracy and speed.}

  abstractNote={Big databases are increasingly widespread and are therefore hard to understand, in exploratory biomedicine science, big data in health research is highly exciting because data-based analyses can travel quicker than hypothesis-based research. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method to reduce the dimensionality of certain datasets. Improves interpretability but without losing much information. It achieves this by creating new covariates that are not related to each other. Finding those new variables, or what we call the main components, will reduce the eigenvalue /eigenvectors solution problem. (PCA) can be said to be an adaptive data analysis technology because technology variables are developed to adapt to different data types and structures. This review will start by introducing the basic ideas of (PCA), describe some concepts related to (PCA), and discussing. What it can do, and reviewed fifteen articles of (PCA) that have been introduced and published in the last three years.},
